I am constantly in awe of the world around me. As a christian I see the work of our creators hands all around me and it is a constant reminder of his unfathomable power contrasted against his care and attention to detail.

## Let there be light
Light is a fundamental component of our universe and essential part of life. We have over the last few centuries learnt so much about light and its composition. Light is an expression of energy, light acts as both discrete and continuous (particle vs wave). Light is timeless. 

Scientists predicts that in the early days of the universe it was too hot and dense for light to exist. A formless soup of subatomic particles unable to bind into atoms due to heat and pressure. Then as the expanding universe cooled it suddenly reached the point where light could exist and there was a blinding flash of primordial light.

This for me echos one of the first verses of the bible, Genesis 1:3,

 > And God said "Let there be light" and there was light - _Genesis 1:3_

This light is still reaching us from the furthest points of our visible universe, an echo of Gods great words ringing through space and time.

Photons are incredible particles. One of the most incredible discoveries of modern science is relativity, that the velocity of a photon is constant from the point of view of any observer. This simple observation has incredible consequences, for this to hold true for observers in motion relative to that photon either distance or time must be observed differently for different observers at motion. Further observations show that time slows down for observers at motion. 

For things travelling at the speed of light time slows down to zero, that is they experience the whole existence of the universe in no time. For that primordial photon God is still commanding them to be and also its end by absorption or the end of time.

That same primordial light has been stretched by expanding space to now be in the microwave frequency. We can hear this light as static on a radio or analog TV. Whenever I hear this I am reminded of primordial light and of that first great command of God.

## From the macroscopic to microscopic
Everywhere around me I see the works of God,
