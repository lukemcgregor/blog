I am quite a private type of person which makes it very hard to talk about the things that are important to me outside of the technical world. Having said that the most important things in my life exist outside of work. This is especially true of what I value most, my relationship with God who created me.

I think that in western society its become incredibly unpopular to talk about God. Often it is when something has stigma attached it is most important to talk about. So I want to do a series on what I believe.

I don't intend this blog to be about convincing you, rather of giving you an insight into me.

- [Beauty in the works of Gods hands]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/beauty-in-the-works-of-Gods-hands/)
- Free will allows me to exist
- Loss and pain
- The offer of a relationship with my creator
- Beyond mortality
- Human society and values

I hope that through this series I will have the courage to share what I value most.
