I've been thinking of making a personal blog for a while in addition to my technical blog. I want to be able to write about things I care about which aren't technical so I created this section. It's not in my regular RSS feed as the thoughts and opinions I want to share here are personal reflections rather than technical information.

I am a Christian, a husband, a father and a geek.
